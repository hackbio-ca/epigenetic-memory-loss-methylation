# Epigenetic Markers of Memory Loss
=========================================================

### Introduction
DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involving the addition of methyl groups to the CG dinucleotide in the DNA sequnce, which can affect gene expression. These can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors, such as aging. Specific DNA methylation sites have beenlinked to various diseases, such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease and cancer, making them promising epigenetic biomarkers for disease prediction.

### Implications
Our findings suggest that blood-derived DNA methylation profiles could serve as a viable biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, offering a minimally invasive alternative to brain tissue based DNA methylation profiles. This has potential to advance biomarker discovery, and complement existing diagnostic pipelines such as neuroimaging. With larger datasets and refined feature selection, this framework could also extend to identifying intermediate states like mild cognitive impairment, contributing to a deeper understanding of disease progression and facilitating translational applications in clinical research.
